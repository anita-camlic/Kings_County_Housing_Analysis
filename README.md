# Kings_County_Housing_Analysis

**Authors**: Ziyuan Wang, Anita Camlic, Samuel Robins

## Overview

We have benn tasked to create a business plan for residential investors. We will provided them three reliable recommendations that they could decide what type of house to be invested. To make these recommendations, we must gather kings county house sale data, get rid of outliers properly, and efficeibtly analyze our results.


## Business Problem

For this project, we want to set our stakeholders as short-term buyer who want to make maximum profit for both buying, renovating, and selling house. House Price is pur primary feature and we are trying to find features that have significant correlation with the house price then make the best profit.


## Data

King's County House Sales Dataset with 21 columns is used in this Analysis. 
Raw data was collected between 2014 and 2015, which contained data relative to the task at hand.

## Methods

We did linear regression analysis and trying to find the corralation between price and features we believed that would have strong correlation with our endogenous (dependent) variable. Both simple linear regression modela and a representative multi-linear regression model was applied.
